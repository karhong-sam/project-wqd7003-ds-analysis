    "**<h2>1.1 Project Background</h2>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a significant global health burden, being responsible for a substantial number of deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVDs accounted for an estimated 17.9 million deaths in 2019, comprising 32% of all global deaths. Among these fatalities, stroke and heart attacks contributed to approximately 85% of the cases (WHO, 2021). This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need to address the causes and implications of CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the economic impact of CVDs is significant. Research conducted in the United States reveals that individuals diagnosed with cardiovascular disease face substantial medical expenses. The average annual cost of healthcare for these patients is approximately $18,953, with hospitalization expenses alone accounting for 42.8% ($8,114) of the total costs (Nicholas et al., 2010). When comparing this cost to the real median household income in the United States in 2010, which was around $49,445 (Bureau Public Information Office, 2010), treating cardiovascular disease amounts to nearly 37.5% of the total annual income. For individuals without medical insurance, this financial burden can significantly impact their ability to access necessary treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar concerns exist in Malaysia, where a substantial portion of healthcare costs is allocated to treating heart patients. In 2017, approximately RM3.93 million out of the total healthcare expenditure of RM9.65 billion, equivalent to around 40%, was attributed to heart disease treatment (The Star, 2022). The rising number of CVD cases and associated medical costs emphasize the need for efficient measures to address this public health challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies in epidemiology and randomized clinical trials have provided compelling evidence that coronary heart disease is largely preventable (Cooper et al., 2000). Understanding the factors contributing to heart disease is crucial in developing effective preventive strategies. Therefore, this project aims to leverage machine learning and statistical techniques to analyze and uncover the key factors associated with heart disease. By gaining insights into these factors, we can further enhance our understanding of CVDs and support the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies.\n",

    "**<h2>1.2 Problem Statement</h2>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have been carried out and have proposed that unhealthy eating habits, tobacco use, high consumption of sugar, being overweight, and excessive body fat are the leading causes of cardiovascular disease(Benjamin et al., 2019),(Niranjana & Meenakshi, 2015). There were quite a few studies applies different machine learning technique to evaluate the risk of CVDs, which include decision trees(SITAR-TĂUT et al., 2009),Extreme Learning Machine (Salam et al., 2015) and Naive Bayes Classifier(Miranda et al., 2016).\n",
    "Thus, the objective of this project is to enhance the accuracy of the classifier by testing various machine learning models.\n"

    "The Heart Disease dataset is a collection of medical information from patients who were tested for heart disease. It contains 1025 instances and 14 attributes, including patient age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST segment, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by flourosopy, thalassemia, and the presence or absence of heart disease.The Cleveland database is the only one that has been utilized by machine learning researchers to date. The main target variable in this dataset is the \"goal\" field, which indicates the presence of heart disease in the patient. This variable is represented by integers ranging from 0 (no presence) to 4. Previous experiments using the Cleveland database have focused on distinguishing between the presence (values 1,2,3,4) and absence (value 0) of heart disease. To ensure patient privacy, the names and social security numbers in the dataset have been replaced with dummy values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the data, the following steps were taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Initial data collection: The dataset was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was provided in a CSV format and was read into a Python Jupyter notebook for analysis.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Data description: The attribute names and descriptions were reviewed to understand what each attribute represented. This information was used to better understand the context of the data.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Exploratory data analysis: The data was visualized using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to identify any outliers, missing values, or potential data quality issues.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Data quality verification: The data was verified to ensure that it was complete, accurate, and relevant for the problem at hand. Any missing or incomplete data was noted for further analysis.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Heart Disease dataset appeared to be well-structured and contained relevant information for the problem at hand. However, further analysis will be needed to ensure that the data is suitable for use in building a machine learning model."
